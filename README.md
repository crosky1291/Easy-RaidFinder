# Easy-RaidFinder

It will allow players to login through OAuth and make raids for a 
specific server , as well as allow them to join raids at a certain time, 
there will also be a voting system that shows which players take their raiding 
experience serious and which don't- players are able to rank other players, 
this way the casual raider can find and sign up for a raid ahead of time, 
and just login at the time the raid was scheduled and play.
